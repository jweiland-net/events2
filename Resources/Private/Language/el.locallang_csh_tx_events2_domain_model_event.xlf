					Currently we have 3 event types:
					1. simple: The event will only be shown at one date.
					2. recurring: The most complex event. You have the possibility to configure nearly everything of this event.
					3. duration: The event has a fixed start and end. Good for trips/travelling tours.

					Please choose an event date in the near future or in the early past.
					That's because of a configuration in ExtensionManager for this extension.
					There you can configure an amount of months for calculating day records in past and future.
					Default: 3 month past. 6 month future. It's up to the admin to change these values.
					If you enter a date with 6 month in past, no day record will be created. So this date will not be displayed in frontend.
