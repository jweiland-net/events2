What does it do?
================

Our events2 is a timeframe based event management system. That means, that only events within this ongoing timeframe
are visible in Frontend. All newer/older events are still accessible, but there is no date calculated for them anymore.

Other than EXT:cal we have only one event record with a huge amount of settings to dynamically calculate the day
records. If you change a description, one event record will be updated only.

You can create different types of events:

* Single: An event for just one day
* Duration: An event like 17.07.2020-20.07.2020
* Recurring: An event like 1st and 3rd monday and friday a month, except 23.07.2020 and different time on friday
